                <p>We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush.</p>

        <h1 id="research" class="section-header">What we found</h1>
            <div class="text-area">
                <p>There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Let that brush dance around there and play. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. </p>

        <h1 id="get-started" class="section-header">How you can get started</h1>
            <div class="text-area">
                <p>And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. Don't fiddle with it all day. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. </p>

        <h1 id="connect" class="section-header">Connect with others</h1>
            <div class="text-area">
                <p>Don't fight it, use what happens. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Here's something that's fun. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. </p>
